2/20/11:
Analyzer:
	x ensure heuristic function for black vs. white
	o clean up endgame utility function: determine win, lose, draw states
	  (2/20 - some problems doing this, couldn't figure it out, gave up for tonight)
    x refactor so the search depth is passed as a parameter counting down to 0.  This will
	  allow for quiescense search, exploring positive-looking paths, etc.
	- transposition table
	- iterative deepening
	- improved heuristics
	- remove MoveWrapper on minimax calls

Board:
	x clean up current board tests
	x pawn promotion
	- order moves by anticipated utility
		- consider partitioning move collections into capturing and non-capturing moves;
		  chance of some weird edge cases when e.g. castling moves are analyzed for check 
		  positions, can also probably improve efficiency when checking for threats not to 
		  iterate over all moves.
	o en-passant
	- other weird chess rules


Game:
	- parse time limit properly
	- set time limits on each search ala what GNU chess does
