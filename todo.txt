Analyzer:
	o clean up endgame utility function: determine win, lose, draw states
	  (2/20 - some problems doing this, couldn't figure it out, gave up for tonight)
	- performance profiling and tuning on the analyzer and the board
	- improved heuristics
	- remove MoveWrapper on minimax calls (?)

Board:
	- order moves by anticipated utility
		- consider partitioning move collections into capturing and non-capturing moves;
		  chance of some weird edge cases when e.g. castling moves are analyzed for check 
		  positions, can also probably improve efficiency when checking for threats not to 
		  iterate over all moves.
	- other weird chess rules - three move draw, 50 move limit

Game:
	- parse time limit properly
	- set time limits on each search ala what GNU chess does
